This app is for everyone who loves their dog and wants to provide the best care, which means keeping them up to date on vaccinations and monthly medicines.  I know I forget if I did it on the 2nd or the 12th or the 20th.  I wanted to provide a place where dog owners can keep track of their best friends health.

I built this app with a PostgreSQL database with a Rails back end and utilized a Bootstrap template and used Handlebars to render the page.  This was the first time I used Handlebars to render data.

In the future I would like the application to store important documents and be able to create a countdown to next medicine application or vaccination.
